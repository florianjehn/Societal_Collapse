I am currently reading the book [Existential Kink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50915816-existential-kink), after a recommendation from a [Sasha Chapin post](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love?s=r) about how to be more okay with yourself. While I sometimes find the framing of the book a bit annoying, I still find it helpful and it has provided me with some insights about myself. The book also has a bunch of exercises and meditations than you can try to work on yourself. As I like guided meditations, I created one myself based on the ideas of the book. Have fun (would not recommend doing this if you are currently depressed):
