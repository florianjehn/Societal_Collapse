When I started my PhD, I also had to do some teaching. Originally my professor asked me if I could continue a course on isotope hydrology, as the teacher at that time was leaving the working group. Problem is, I don't know much about isotope hydrology (apart from the things I learned when I took this course). However, I can do some environmental data science. Therefore, I pitched my professor that I would like to create a Python course, that teaches students to get from zero Python Knowledge, to being able to do some basic data exploration with large datasets. He liked the idea and I have been teaching this course for the last four years. I am quite happy with the result and the students seem to like it as well. So, if you want to learn environmental Python or have to teach a course in this direction, you can find all materials in [this repository](https://github.com/florianjehn/python-for-environmental-science).
