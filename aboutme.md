Hi, I'm Florian,

I use this place here to try to understand the world and my thoughts.

I see myself as an agreeable and curious person, who likes to explore the world in a playful manner. My main interests are climate change, existential risks, feminism, history, forecasting and food security. 

After doing a bachelor, master and doctor in environmental science I am currently trying to explore how I can work on more impactful topics as those that I have covered in the past. 

If I am not engaged in one of the topics above, it is likely that you find me doing sport, meditation, reading, going for a walk or enjoying time with the wonderful people in my life.

See you around :)

P.S. you can find an updated version of my academic CV [here](https://florianjehn.github.io/assets/misc/Florian_Jehn_Academic_CV_June_22.pdf).
