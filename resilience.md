title: Resilience
---
How a society reacts to a catastrophic event is important and it is strongly influenced by how resilient it is. Resilience, in this context, refers to the capacity of a society to absorb shocks and the abundance of resources at its disposal for post-disaster reconstruction. This safety net, vital for recovery, is not an innate quality of a society but rather an something that can be constructed and enhanced or neglected.
